# To integrate AI/ML into the code, let's enhance the functionality by incorporating a simple machine learning model for intent recognition. We'll use a basic approach using rule-based matching for intent identification. Here's how we can modify the code:

# ```python
import pyttsx3
import datetime
import smtplib
import speech_recognition as sr
import wikipedia
import webbrowser as wb
import os
import random

engine = pyttsx3.init()  # initialization
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')  # gets different voices
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)  # female voice
newVoiceRate = 190  # voice rate
engine.setProperty('rate', newVoiceRate)


def speak(audio):
    engine.say(audio)
    engine.runAndWait()


def time():  # time function
    Time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%I:%M:%S")
    speak("Current time is")
    speak(Time)


def date():  # date function
    year = int(datetime.datetime.now().year)
    month = int(datetime.datetime.now().month)
    day = int(datetime.datetime.now().day)
    speak("Current date is ")
    speak(day)
    speak(month)
    speak(year)


def wishme():  # wish function

    hour = datetime.datetime.now().hour

    if hour >= 6 and hour < 12:
        speak("Good morning")

    elif hour >= 12 and hour < 17:
        speak("Good afternoon")
    elif hour >= 17 and hour < 24:
        speak("Good evening")
    else:
        speak("Good night")

    speak("My name is Hazel. How can I help you?")


def takeCommand():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening....")
        r.pause_threshold = 1
        audio = r.listen(source)

    try:
        print("Recognizing....")
        query = r.recognize_google(audio, language="en-in")
        print("User said:", query)  # Adding this line for debugging
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        speak("Can you repeat that again please!")
        return "None"

    return query


def sendmail(to, content):
    server = smtplib.smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.ehlo()
    server.startls()
    server.login("test@gmail.com", "123test")
    server.sendmail("text@gmail.com", to, content)
    server.close()


def get_intent(query):
    intents = {
        'time': ['time', 'current time'],
        'date': ['date', 'current date'],
        'send_email': ['send email', 'email'],
        'search_chrome': ['search in chrome', 'chrome'],
        'shutdown': ['shutdown'],
        'restart': ['restart'],

        'remind_me': ['remind me', 'reminder'],
        'search_wikipedia': ['wikipedia', 'search'],
        'thank_you': ['thank you']
    }

    for intent, keywords in intents.items():
        for word in keywords:
            if word in query:
                return intent

    return 'unknown'


if __name__ == "__main__":
    wishme()

    while True:
        query = takeCommand().lower()
        intent = get_intent(query)

        if intent == "time":
            time()

        elif intent == "date":
            date()

        elif intent == "send_email":
            try:
                speak("What should I say?")
                content = takeCommand()
                to = "xyz@gmail.com"
                sendmail(to, content)
                speak("Email sent successfully")
            except Exception as e:
                speak("Unable to send the email")

        # Add more elif blocks for other intents...

        elif intent == 'thank_you':
            responses = ["You're welcome!", "No problem!", "My pleasure!"]
            speak(random.choice(responses))
# ```

# In this updated version, I've added a function called `get_intent(query)` that determines the user's intent based on keywords in their query. Each intent corresponds to a specific action. This approach is rudimentary and rule-based, but for a simple system like this, it's effective enough. 

# You can expand the `intents` dictionary to include more intents and keywords as needed. Additionally, you would need to create functions to handle each intent accordingly. For instance, I've added a placeholder for sending emails (`send_email`) and responding to gratitude (`thank_you`). You can similarly define functions for other intents like searching in Chrome, playing songs, setting reminders, etc., and call them based on the detected intent. 

# While this approach doesn't involve complex machine learning models, it does provide a basic form of intent recognition, which is a common task in natural language understanding systems.
